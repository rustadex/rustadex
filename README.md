# Rustadex

This is a placeholder crate for the upcoming **Rustadex** codex.

The goal of this project is to provide a unified, ergonomic facade for a suite of powerful Rust libraries, including `stderr` for CLI UI, and future crates for parsing and core utilities.

This crate is currently under active development and is not yet functional. Please check the [repository](https://github.com/rustadex/rustadex) for updates.
